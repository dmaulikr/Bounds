# The Game

This game is based on boundaries (hence the name), where by touching the screen you increase the size
of the red circle in the center. Your objective is to keep the red circle in the green zone for three seconds.
You will find that this task gets increasingly difficult with more variables in the equation.

# Features

My partners and I are very open to new ideas for this game, so if you have any suggestions, please
feel free to create a fork and add your own features. We will be sure to take a look, and possibly add
the feature to the game!
